# The traits in these folders are OpenRA trait duplicates.

This means they are edited traits - might be even outdated variants - of their OpenRA equvivalents, with some minor changes involved. Might not even work with everything their base traits work with properly.

Avoid using them unless you are explicitly sure the changed traits are exactly what you're looking for.
