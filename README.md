# Red Alert 2: Romanov's Vengeance

Romanov's Vengeance is a 3rd party OpenRA mod based on OpenRA Red Alert 2 mod. It aims to create a Red Alert 2 with balanced multiplayer experience, improvements that comes from OpenRA and other improvements from more modern Command & Conquer games. A custom campaign is also being planned, but not much of a work is done on it yet.


Please note that mod is still under developement, even the playtest versions are susceptible to bugs. There are still a few features from the original game that are still missing, there are seveal placeholder artwork and new stuff and balancing are always subject to change.

Installing the mod is done the same way as another [OpenRAModSDK](http://www.github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK) mod.
